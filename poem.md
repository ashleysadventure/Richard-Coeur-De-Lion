**Richard Coeur De Lion** :heart::lion:

*Marriott Edgar*

Richard the First, Coeur-de-Lion, <br>
Is a name that we speak of with pride, <br>
Though he only lived six months in England <br>
From his birth to the day that he died.  <br>

He spent all his time fighting battles,  <br>
Dressed up in most rigid attire,  <br>
For he had his suits made by the Blacksmith,  <br>
And his underwear knitted of wire.  <br>

He married a lady from Flanders,  <br>
Berengaria's what they called her;  <br>
She turned out a good wife to Richard,  <br>
In spite of a name like that there.  <br>

For when he came home from his fighting  <br>
She'd bandage the wounds in his sconce,  <br>
And every time a snake bit him  <br>
She'd suck out the poison at once.  <br>

In their 'ouse they'd a minstrel called Blondel  <br>
To amuse them at t'end of the day'  <br>
And the King had but one thing against him... <br>
He had nobbut one tune he could play.  <br>

The Queen saw nowt wrong with the number  <br>
And would have it again and again,  <br>
And when Richard said: "Put a sock in it!"  <br>
She'd give 'im a look full of pain.  <br>

The King got fed up at the finish,  <br>
And were so sick of 'earing it played,  <br>
That he packed his spare suit on a wagon  <br>
And went off and joined the Crusade. <br>

He got fighting the moment he landed, <br>
And though Saracen lads did their best,  <br>
He cut off their heads in such numbers,  <br>
That the hatmakers lodged a protest.  <br>

The Sultan, whose name were Saladin,  <br>
Thought he'd best try this business to stem, <br>
So he rode up to Richard and told him  <br>
He mustn't do that there to them.  <br>

Said Richard: "Oh! Who's going to stop me?"  <br>
Said Saladin: "I will-and quick!"  <br>
So the King poked his sword at the Sultan,  <br>
Who, in turn, swiped his skimpter at Dick.  <br>

They fought all that day without ceasing;  <br>
They fought till at last they both saw  <br>
That each was a match for the other,  <br>
So they chucked it and called it a draw.  <br>

As Richard rode home in the moonlight  <br>
He heard someone trying to croon,  <br>
And there by the roadside stood Blondel,  <br>
Still playing his signature tune.  <br>

He'd worked out his passage from England  <br>
In search of his Master and Lord,  <br>
And had swum the last part of the journey  <br>
'Cos his tune got 'im thrown overboard.  <br>

This meeting filled Richard with panic:  <br>
He rode off and never drew rein  <br>
Till he got past the Austrian border  <br>
And felt he could breathe once again.  <br>

He hid in a neighbouring Castle, <br>
But he hadn't been there very long  <br>
When one night just outside his window  <br>
Stood Blondel, still singing his song.  <br>

This 'ere took the heart out of Richard; <br>
He went home dejected and low,  <br>
And the very next fight he got into  <br>
He were killed without striking a blow.  <br>
